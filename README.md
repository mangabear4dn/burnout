# Burnout

Mental health issues are among the most difficult illnesses to diagnose and treat. Oftentimes because you might seem perfectly alright to anyone around you but at the same time doing the basic things necessary to take care of yourself is a daily challenge.

I have lately been having a hard time dealing with burnout and it has made my anxiety and depression a lot harder to manage as well but one of the things that I have found helpful is mapping my emotions. 

Some of the useful tools for that are:

- [Feelings wheel](https://feelingswheel.com/)
- [Emotions classifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_classification)
- [Plutchik's wheel of emotions](https://www.betterup.com/blog/emotion-wheel)
- and others

These of course cannot substitute regular consultations with a professional mental health specialist or having a proper emotional support system around you but I have in my personal experience found these tools helpful for matching the way I feel with a words other than 'bad' or 'empty' and that makes it easier to communicate how I feel to others around me.

## Project idea

The website offers an online test that helps narrow down what sort of emotion a person is feeling based on how they answer the test. The test would be based on the relations shown in different wheels of feeling an emotions.

This website would be intended only as one of many ways of self-exploration of sensations and in no way is meant to be a tool for diagnosing a mental illness of any kind.

The website would offer to log in either as an anonymous user or with social media links.

The website would have an option to make a donation to the site owner but it would be completely voluntary. 

The project is still in the beginning phase at the moment because of my personal burnout at the moment.
